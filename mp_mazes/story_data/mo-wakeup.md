Its a beautiful morning in Savoy and Mo has just woken up alongside his best friend Noa. He feels an itch on the back of his head and scratches it figorously. When he is done scratching he looks at his hand and wonders how it snowed in his room again last night. To shower or not to shower? He pretends to think and then makes his decision.
