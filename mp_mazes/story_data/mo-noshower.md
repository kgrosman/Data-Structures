Mo opens his closet and realizes that he has opened the wrong closet--this one only has GAP kids and rainbow sweaters. He opens his college apparel closet and is happy. He decides to wear three college shirts today but must decide which to wear on the outer layer. Should it be MIT, Cornell, or UIUC?

# mo-mit
Mo picks the MIT shirt.

# mo-cornell
Mo picks the Cornell shirt so he can show Chan that he is above him. He heads to the mirror to see how he looks.

# mo-uiuc
Mo picks the UIUC shirt so he can look humble for a while but then take it off later to reveal one of the other shirts. He heads to mirror to see how he looks.
